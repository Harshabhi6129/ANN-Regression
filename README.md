Description:
This repository contains the implementation of an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) classification model to predict customer churn. The model is trained on the Churn Modelling Dataset, a dataset commonly used to analyze customer behavior and predict whether a customer is likely to leave a service or business.

The project includes:

Model Training: A robust ANN classification model built with TensorFlow/Keras to classify customers based on various features, such as credit score, balance, age, and activity status.
Streamlit Application: A user-friendly web application developed using Streamlit that allows users to input customer details and predict whether they are likely to churn.
Deployment: The application is deployed on Streamlit Cloud for real-time predictions.
