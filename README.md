# ANN-Regression

**App link:** https://ann-regression-ctsdsmlxydxw996ytu692p.streamlit.app/

**Description:** This repository contains the implementation of an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) regression model to predict customer behavior. The model is trained on the Churn Modelling Dataset, a dataset commonly used to analyze customer attributes and predict specific outcomes, such as estimated salary or related metrics.

**The project includes:**

**Model Training:** A robust ANN regression model built with TensorFlow/Keras to predict outcomes based on various features, such as credit score, balance, age, and activity status.

**Streamlit Application:** A user-friendly web application developed using Streamlit that allows users to input customer details and predict the estimated outcome (e.g., salary).

**Deployment:** The application is deployed on Streamlit Cloud for real-time predictions.
